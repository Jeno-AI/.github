## Hi there 👋 Welcome to Jeno's Open Source Space.

**Jeno Open Source Workflows** is a public collection of practical, production-ready workflows that help **e-commerce brands improve product discovery and drive more sales** using **generative marketing and AI-assisted systems**.

This repository acts as the **open knowledge layer** of Jeno — a place where builders, marketers, and operators can learn how modern discovery-led commerce works and contribute real workflows back to the community.

---

## 🌍 What is Jeno?

Jeno is a generative marketing platform built for modern e-commerce brands navigating the shift from **search-based shopping → discovery-based shopping**.

Instead of optimizing only for traffic, Jeno focuses on:
- Product-first storytelling  
- Continuous discovery across social feeds  
- Turning attention into purchase without friction  

This repository documents the **workflows behind that philosophy**.

## 🛠️ How to Use These Workflows

Jeno workflows are designed to be **tool-agnostic** and **easy to adapt**. You can use them in multiple ways depending on your setup and level of control.

---

#### Option 1: Import into n8n (Recommended)

Most workflows in this repository are provided as **JSON files**.

**How it works:**
1. Download the workflow JSON from this repository  
2. Open your **n8n** instance  
3. Import the JSON file  
4. Configure the required credentials and environment variables  
5. Run the workflow and iterate  

This is the fastest way to get a working, end-to-end automation.

---

#### Option 2: Generate Your Own Tools (Vibe Coding)

Each workflow is also documented so you can:
- Use the prompts directly in **Cursor**
- Adapt them using other **AI-powered coding tools**
- Rebuild the workflow in your preferred stack

This approach is ideal if you want:
- Full control over the implementation  
- Custom integrations and logic  
- A deeper understanding of how the workflow works  

---

#### Required Setup (Important)

These workflows are **not plug-and-play**. To make them functional, you will need to set up relevant APIs and services, such as:

- **Google Gemini API** (generative reasoning, planning, and copy)
- **Shopify API** (product catalog and store data)
- Additional third-party APIs depending on the workflow

You’ll also need to configure:
- Environment variables  
- API keys and credentials  
- Webhooks (where applicable)

Each workflow clearly documents its dependencies and setup steps.

---

#### AI + Human Collaboration

These workflows are intentionally designed with **human-in-the-loop checkpoints**.

AI helps with:
- Speed and scale  
- Exploration and variations  

Humans remain responsible for:
- Judgment and strategy  
- Final decisions and execution  

Think of these workflows as **accelerators**, not replacements.
